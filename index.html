    <p>Bangladesh wrapped up the lone Test against Afghanistan inside 10 sessions as they registered a mammoth 546-run win at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur on Saturday.</p>
    <p>The margin of victory, in terms of runs, is the highest achieved by the Tigers -- or by any team in the 21st century -- and it's the third-largest in Test cricket's history.</p>

<p>Resuming the fourth day on 45 for two, chasing a record 662 runs target set by the hosts, Afghanistan eventually were bundled out for 115, unable to tackle the pace battery of the hosts. Taskin Ahmed grabbed a four-wicket haul while Shoriful Islam scalped three and Ebadot Hossain bagged one -- the first wicket today â€“ in the second innings.</p>

<p>On the batting front, Najmul Hossain Shanto continued to impress as the left-hander struck centuries in both the innings. The southpaw became only the second Bangladeshi to score hundreds in both the innings of a Test match after Mominul Haque, laying the platform for an emphatic victory.
</p><br>
<p>The 24-year-old has been in prime form across all the formats for Bangladesh in recent times. Shanto informed that he was clear of his batting plan when it comes to performing across all formats.</p>

<p>"As a player we need to perform in all the formats, so I was very clear about my plan and I need to work really hard in future to continue my batting form," said Shanto during the post-match presentation.</p><br><br>
<p>According to Shanto, the Player of the Match, the sporting Mirpur pitch provided the opportunity for the batters to showcase their ability. </p>
<br><br>
<p>"Yes, it was a good opportunity for the batters since we don't get such wickets often, but the way all the batters batted it really helped the team. The way our bowlers bowled was also impressive," he added.</p><br><br>
<p>Meanwhile, skipper Liton Das started off on the right not in his first outing as the Tigers Test captain. He praised the team for showing character despite extreme hot weather.</p><br><br>
<p>"I am very happy with the way the boys played this game. The weather was very hot and it's not easy in such weather. Credit goes to our batters, especially Shanto alongside Mahmudul Hasan Joy. Zakir [Hasan] and Mominul also batted well in the second innings. Our bowlers also did a great job in this hot weather, so it's good to see," said Liton.</p><br>
